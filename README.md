# TravelAnywhere is a web Mvc intended for a relocation service or extended vacations. Short ones are allowed to.

Searches can be filtered by location (city, and country) T
he only location I have in the database, is Cancun, Mexico 
Region Price and date options were supposed to be included (a partial resemblance to what I had before remains on the main page) 
They still work but as I had so many changes needed late in the game will not filter 
Just click on Region at the top and I have included links to all of my other index views to check functionality
