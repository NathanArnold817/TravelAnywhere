# TravelAnywhere is a web Mvc intended for a relocation service or extended vacations. Short ones are allowed to.

Searches can be filtered by location (city, and country) 
The only location I have in the database, is Cancun, Mexico 
Region Price and date options were supposed to be included (a partial resemblance to what I had before remains on the main page) T
